## Guild Creation

Multi-platform gating in one guild is not currently possible, but good news: we are working on it.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I create multiple guilds on one Discord server?</summary>

No, you can only create one guild on one server.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I create a guild on a Discord server that’s not mine?</summary>

Yes, but only if you have administrator permissions on that server.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why does the Guild.xyz bot role need to be above every other user’s role on Discord?</summary>

The bot can only add/remove roles if its permission is on the top of the ones it has to manage.

</details>

## Guild Management

<details>

<summary>Can I have more admins in my guild?</summary>

Yes, multi-admin management is available. If you want to have more admins in your guild, you can add multiple addresses in the 'Edit Guild' section.\

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is it possible to make my guild more private?</summary>

Absolutely! There are 3 ways to have more privacy around your guild:

1. Hiding your guild from explorer (Note: by URL, it can be found)
2. Hiding your members' addresses
3. Hiding the addresses on your allowlists

</details>

## Roles

<details>

<summary>Will the Guild.xyz bot also create the roles on my Discord server?</summary>

Yes! When you create a role in your guild, the bot will automatically add it to your Discord server with the same name.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will the Guild.xyz bot remove roles if a member doesn't fulfil the requirements anymore?</summary>

Yes, We’re listening to blockchain events and manage roles in real-time based on these events.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why does the bot give ' ' role on my Discord server?</summary>

This happens when you delete the role that the Guild.xyz bot has created on your server.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I add more roles in my guild?</summary>

Yes, of course! If it's up to us, you can add an infinite number of roles, but on Discord the maximum is 250.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why the bot doesn't give roles on my server?</summary>

If that happens then the Guild.xyz bot role is not above every other user roles it has to manage on Discord. It’s the only way for the bot to add/remove roles to/from your members.

</details>

## Wallet Management & Safety

<details>

<summary>Is connecting my wallet on guild.xyz safe?</summary>

Absolutely! When you sign in with guild.xyz, you only are validating ownership of the wallet address. The Guild.xyz bot does not get any permissions to perform transactions, and does not have any way of withdrawing anything from your wallet.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do I need to sign a message in addition to connecting my wallet?</summary>

Signing is the only way we can truly know that you are the owner of the wallet you are connecting. Signing is a safe, gas-less transaction that does not in any way give Guild.xyz permission to perform any transactions with your wallet.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I link more addresses under my account for requirement checks?</summary>

Yes! If you join a guild with a different address but the same Discord account, your addresses will be linked together and both will be used to check requirements.\

## Guild Creation

<details>

<summary>Can I gate my Discord server and Telegram group within one guild?</summary>

Multi-platform gating in one guild is not currently possible, but we are working on it.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I create multiple guilds on one Discord server?</summary>

No, you can only create one guild on one server.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I create a guild on a Discord server that’s not mine?</summary>

Yes, but only if you have administrator permissions on that server.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why does the Guild.xyz bot role need to be above every other user’s role on Discord?</summary>

The bot can only add/remove roles if its permission is on the top of the ones it has to manage.

</details>

## Wallet Management & Safety

<details>

<summary>Is connecting my wallet on guild.xyz safe?</summary>

Absolutely! When you sign in with guild.xyz, you only are validating ownership of the wallet address. The Guild.xyz bot does not get any permissions to perform transactions, and does not have any way of withdrawing anything from your wallet.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do I need to sign a message in addition to connecting my wallet?</summary>

Signing is the only way we can truly know that you are the owner of the wallet you are connecting. Signing is a safe, gas-less transaction that does not in any way give Guild.xyz permission to perform any transactions with your wallet.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I link more addresses under my account for requirement checks?</summary>

Yes! If you join a guild with a different address but the same Discord account, your addresses will be linked together and both will be used to check requirements.\

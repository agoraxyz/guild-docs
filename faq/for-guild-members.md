# For Guild Members

## Roles

<details>

<summary>How can I get my roles while on a Discord server?</summary>

All you need to do is verify your wallet and hit the Guild.xyz bot ‘Join’ button on the server.

<details>

<summary>How do I know if I’ve already got my roles on Discord?</summary>

Once you join a guild, your roles will appear under your name. You can check them by clicking on your name while on the server.

<summary>Why do I get the "You do not have access to any guilds on this server." message from the bot when I know I fulfil the requirements?</summary>

There are different scenarios that can cause this message to pop up:

1. You’re connected to the wrong chain/network.\
   In this case, you can [change the network easily](https://autofarm.gitbook.io/autofarm-network/how-tos/defi-beginners-guide/switching-networks-on-metamask).
2. You’re connected, but with not the correct address.\
   Maybe you meet the requirements - you have the specific tokens, you are on the allowlist etc. - but you have multiple addresses, and right now you use the one that can’t get you in.\
   In this case, double-check your connected wallet and linked addresses in your [Guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz) Account whether you use the correct one to get your roles.\

3. Your address is connected to another Discord ID.
4. The Guild.xyz bot doesn’t have permissions to manage roles on the server.
5. If none of them above, unfortunately it’s a bug. In this case, please contact the Guild.xyz team on Discord so we can solve your issue.

## Wallet Management & Safety

<details>

<summary>Is connecting my wallet on guild.xyz safe?</summary>

Absolutely! When you sign in with guild.xyz, you only are validating ownership of the wallet address. The Guild.xyz bot does not get any permissions to perform transactions, and does not have any way of withdrawing anything from your wallet.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do I need to sign a message in addition to connecting my wallet?</summary>

Signing is the only way we can truly know that you are the owner of the wallet you are connecting. Signing is a safe, gas-less transaction that does not in any way give Guild.xyz permission to perform any transactions with your wallet.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I link multiple addresses under my account for requirement checks?</summary>

Yes! If you join a guild with a different address but the same Discord account, your addresses will be linked together and both will be used to check requirements.\

# About Guild Guard

<details>

<summary>What's Guild Guard?</summary>

[Guild Guard](https://guard.guild.xyz/) is a Web3 CAPTCHA to combat bots with the power of Ethereum. It provides full protection against Discord scams acting like a security layer on your server. With the activated Guard, bad actor bots won't see any channels or members of your community on your Discord. No more unwanted messages, phishing attacks, DM scams and announcement channel posts impersonating moderators.

<summary>What happens if I leave the Discord server without leaving the guild on <a href="http://guild.xyz/">guild.xyz</a>?</summary>

If you don’t leave the guild on the interface but from the server, the Guild.xyz bot will also automatically drop you from the guild

_Notes: When you log back in to the server via an invite link after leaving it, the bot will automatically put you back into the guild so you will also be authenticated again so you won’t be quarantined._

<summary>What happens if I ever joined a guild but I'm on a server where the Guard just got activated?</summary>

If you need to authenticate yourself to access the server, you will be quarantined, but by pressing the 'Join' button you can log in immediately without having to verify your wallet again.

<summary>What happens if I delete the entry channel or move the ‘Join’ button to a different channel after adding the Guard to my guild already?</summary>

If you change the entry channel where people have to authenticate themselves, or you adjust the permission setups, not verified users won’t be able to see anything on your server.

It can only be adjusted with certain settings, so the easiest solution is switching the Guard off and setting it up again.

_**Important Note:** If you turn the Guard off, you need to reset the role permissions to @everyone because all channels become private after enabling the Guild Guard automatically. So before you want to set it up again, first you need to adjust the channel permissions because the bot can see only those channels which is visible for everyone._

<summary>How can I switch off the Guild Guard and what happens with my server afterwards?</summary>

Go to your guild settings and turn off the Guard by signing a message in the 'Security' section.

All channels on the server will automatically become private after turning on the Guild Guard, so if you turn the Guard off, you will need to reset the role permissions to @everyone.
